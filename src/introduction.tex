In, today's ever evolving modern and busy world email is a simple yet very important source
of communication between various groups of people due to personal, business, corporate
and government use-cause reasons.
Over the past few years, the usages of email have greatly increased as
the internet has revolutionized many parts of the world.
Unfortunately, as the number of email users increases, \textbf{SPAM}(also known as junk email)
email targeting general users also increases.
These \textbf{SPAM} emails, which are being sent to numerous recipients, are identical in
nature and being very annoying, they pose various security vulnerabilities to the
client's device if not handled properly.
Apart from that, these \textbf{SPAM} emails take away a lot of precious time from the user
and cause financial loss to corporations and businesses.
To prevent that and make efficient use of emails, in this project I
used various text mining strategies to extract meaningful information from
emails text and used various machine learning algorithms to figure out which one is optimal to
use for spam email detection in common day-to-day life scenarios.
