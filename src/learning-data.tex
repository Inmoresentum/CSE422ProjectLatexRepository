The dataset that I used for this project from kaggle\cite{spam-email-detection-dataset}
is called \textbf{\textit{spam email detection dataset}}, and itâ€™s a raw.
The initial data set of was \textbf{5730} rows and \textbf{110} columns,
and many of the columns were not necessary for further use cases.
The first thing I had to do was preprocess the dataset and took it to
a usable state for further text processing and tokenization/word frequency count.
